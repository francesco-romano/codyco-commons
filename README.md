This library contains useful functions developed in the (former monolithic) CoDyCo project.

Currently it includes:
* support for LockGuard (already included in the next YARP version)
* Mathematical utilities such as pseudoinversion and 3D skew symmetric matrices from 3D vector.
* Model parsing utility
